import textwrap

#this is how to wrap text using python's built in function

desc = """According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. 
It's wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. 
The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible"""
myWrap = textwrap.TextWrapper(width=40)
wrapList = myWrap.wrap(text=desc)

for line in wrapList:
    print(line)

### that is to wrap all and print all. rather simple tbh 
### now what about a single sentance? 

singleLine = "According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly."
print("\n\n" + myWrap.fill(text=singleLine))

### again rather simple. but what if we want to set a specific length? well thats rather simple too

short = textwrap.shorten(text = desc, width=150)
print('\n\n' + myWrap.fill(text = short))

### see, yet again rather simple
